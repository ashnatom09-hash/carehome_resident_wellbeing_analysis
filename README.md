## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)
- Imported raw dataset into Jupyter Notebook
- Handled missing values
- Standardized categorical variables
- Generated summary statistics
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identified correlations between wellbeing and other variables

### 2. SQL Data Analysis (PostgreSQL)
- Created structured queries using SELECT, GROUP BY, and aggregation functions
- Calculated average wellbeing scores
- Analyzed activity participation levels
- Evaluated hydration and cognitive status impact
- Generated grouped summaries for reporting

### 3. Data Visualization (Power BI)
- Built interactive dashboard
- Created KPI card for total residents
- Developed bar charts and comparison visuals
- Added slicers for filtering by demographic and health factors
- Enabled interactive exploration of wellbeing metrics
